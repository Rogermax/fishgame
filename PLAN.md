# Fishing Game Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for our high-quality fishing game. The goal is to evolve the game from a solid MVP to an addictive, visually stunning experience.

## Phase 1: MVP (Logic & Mechanics)
**Focus:** solid gameplay logic, bug-free mechanics, basic placeholder visuals.

- [ ] **Core Mechanics**:
    - [ ] Reliable casting and reeling physics.
    - [ ] Accurate collision detection (hook vs fish).
    - [ ] Basic fish AI (movement patterns, fleeing).
- [ ] **Visuals**:
    - [ ] Use basic geometric shapes (circles, rectangles) for fish and hook.
    - [ ] No textures yet; focus on clear visual feedback (colors, animations).
- [ ] **UI**:
    - [ ] Simple HUD showing depth, score/money.
    - [ ] Basic inventory or catch log.

## Phase 2: Addictive Gameplay (Progression)
**Focus:** Retention, economy, and "just one more cast" feeling.

- [ ] **Economy System**:
    - [ ] Exponential cost/reward curve.
    - [ ] Fish value increases significantly with depth and rarity.
- [ ] **Upgrades**:
    - [ ] Line length (reach deeper zones).
    - [ ] Hook size/strength (catch bigger fish).
    - [ ] Reeling speed.
    - [ ] Boat/Storage capacity.
- [ ] **Zones & Exploration**:
    - [ ] Unlock new fishing zones with distinct fish types and environments.
    - [ ] Deeper zones require better gear.
- [ ] **Rewards**:
    - [ ] Daily bonuses.
    - [ ] Achievements/Trophies.
    - [ ] Rare "Jackpot" fish.

## Phase 3: Visual Polish (The "Wow" Factor)
**Focus:** High-end graphics, immersion, and aesthetics.

- [ ] **Art Style**:
    - [ ] Replace shapes with high-quality sprites or 3D models.
    - [ ] Consistent art direction (e.g., stylized, pixel art, or realistic).
- [ ] **Effects**:
    - [ ] Water shaders (reflection, refraction, waves).
    - [ ] Particle effects for splashing, reeling, and catching.
    - [ ] Dynamic lighting and day/night cycle.
- [ ] **Polish**:
    - [ ] Smooth UI animations (glassmorphism, parallax).
    - [ ] Sound design (ambient water, reel sounds, success chimes).
    - [ ] Haptic feedback (if supported).
